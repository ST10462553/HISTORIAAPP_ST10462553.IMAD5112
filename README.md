# Introduction
# Hi there! Greetings from Siyolise Ndololwana, an enthusiastic eighteen-year-old living in the lively town of Fort Beaufort. This document provides a quick overview of my journey, emphasizing my deep love for programming in spite of the difficulties I faced.

# Background
## Growing up in Fort Beaufort, I've always been captivated by technology and its endless possibilities. My fascination with programming sparked at a young age when I discovered the power of coding to create and innovate. Despite the limited resources and opportunities in my hometown, I embarked on a quest to delve deeper into the world of programming.

# Mindset
## For me, programming is more than just a skillâ€”it'sa passion that feeds my spirit. I'm hooked by the excitement of finding solutions to challenging issues, the delight of watching lines of code come to life, and the limitless creative possibilities. My experience with programming hasn't been without its challenges, though. I've come across innumerable obstacles, innumerable bugs, and intimidating mistakes. However, every failure only strengthens my resolve to develop and learn. 

# Plans for the future.
## In the world of coding, errors are unavoidable, but I've come to accept them completely. Every flaw and every mistake is a chance for me to improve and broaden my knowledge. Failures don't depress me; instead, I view them as stepping stones on the path to mastery. I keep expanding my knowledge and looking for ways to get better by being tenacious and resilient. 

# Goals
## My goal as I progress through my programming journey is to learn about new technologies and broaden my horizons. The possibilities are endless, ranging from artificial intelligence to web development. I can't wait to have a significant impact and add to the dynamic tech scene. 

# Conclusion
## In summary, I would say that being a programmer is more than just writing code; it's a journey of personal development, invention, and self-awareness. I'm still passionate about programming even with all the obstacles. I get stronger and more determined than ever after overcoming each obstacle. I appreciate you taking the time to learn a little bit more about who I am. 

# A functional Android application project written in Kotlin to enable users to input their age, prompting the app to  dislay information about historical figures and their age of passing.

# This assignment was built to test the knowledge of students and to make an attempt towards building an application that may become useful or educational to potential users. Every aspect of this assignment is sample code which makes an attempt at reaching its goals and objectives towards the following:
* Enable the intake of user input specifically based on the age of the user
* Ensure that once a user inputs their age on the app, the app displays a message informing the user of the significance of the age inputted(by informing them of a famous figure who passed at that particular age).
* The user has the option of clearing their age history, thus the app resets and the user can enter either a new age or the same one to get a different famous figure's information.
* Error handling-wise, the app should prevent users from inputing values such as "37.5".The age must strictly be an integer "37", likeso.
* A functioning UI for user's convinient experience while navigating the app.

## Issues and pointers to take note of(work in progress):
## Please take note that this assignment is still in progress and I am still making it a point to perfect this assignment. With that being said I would like to give out a few pointers (regarding issues you may run into):

* The program may crash upon entering due to some syntax errors ( specifically overload errors) that I have run into.
*  The button functionality process is still in progress and will be adressed once the issue is handled.
* I have created a function on the application that will enable a user to tap a vector art image (in the app) and automatically be redirected to wikipedia. - This was to further give light and educate users of the figure in the picture.( namely, Amy Winehouse).
  ## Image(s) appearing in the app:

## Purpose of the assignment:
* The purpose of this project is having to gain knowledge on how to implement basic coding skills in Kotlin (programming language). during the course of this project I have learnt how to do basic designing throught the use of android studio. android studio is basically an IDE ( Integrated development environment), software that assists programmers to code more efficiently, either by pointing suggestions, syntax errors or typos made in the code. During the coarse of this project I have learnt concepts such as:
* differenciating between "var" and "val"- to explain deeply into these two concepts, once "var" is declared in code it enables the programmer to let the program change values as oppossed to "val" , which aims to keep a value the same and prevents any change being done.
* In the process of making this project, I've learnt how to track my progress in programming by "recording" or "journaling" through making a Github reposetary and making a ReadMe file. Which, I believe is a staple aspect in programming considering the fact that projects.
* I gained an experience is designing an application through the use of the activity main.xml file (Android Studio)
* using this project as a learning curb to correct my mistakes in any future projects or plans to fix the app's issues.

 ## How to make a github repository from scratch:
  1. sign in using your email, mobile number,etc
  2. Github will then request you to type in a login code(this is if you are signing in from a different account)
  3. for extra security, to verify that you are not a robot, you will go through 20 puzzles to match to verify that you are a human.
  4. After the sign in has been verified, write your username.
  5. After this process is finished, you will be directed to the homepage where details of your account are put on display.
  6. Select "new" to create a new repository.( here you can write a description,this is optional)
  7. Select either private or public ( to determine if you want only certain people to view the repository or if the general public can see it.

# HOW TO ACCESS THE KOTLIN SOURCE CODE OF THE APP:
## Point of notice:
* Please note that the files for the application are accessible under the code tab on the home page of this repository.
* Also take note that should you, as a reader, would like to be more informed of this project's development or it's details. Navigate through the repository and click "Readme". This will not only guide you in finding the source code and any other resource file of the project but it will also shed some light on this project's background.
